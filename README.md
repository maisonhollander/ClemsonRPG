Help me find my dog, Luna. She's hiding somewhere in the house.
User must traverse the map in order to find Luna.
She will always be in the bedroom, in the closet.
Luna is the other character in the game and the interactable object (Evan said this was okay).


To run the game, type make and then press enter. Then type make run and press enter. 
Rules:
1. You have to use yes or no unless prompted otherwise during the game
2. You can check each room more than once.
3. You can give up during the game before finding Luna by typing "Give up" when entering a exit
